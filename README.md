# Yokainoie - 妖怪の家
A home for yokai

Yokai no ie is a virtual pet for the arduino using a SSD1306. 

Was built on the Pro micro, but end product is made for the UNO.

Wiring diagram will be uploaded eventially. 

You create (3d print) a space for a Yokai to inhabit. One will fill the space as a spirit "blob" at first, until it is comfortable enough to reveal its true form to you. Keep track of the Yokai's emotions, play games with it, feed it treats while it inhabits your space. 


9/3 Update - Working menu - the menu selection works
working on adding JKP mini- game.

Yokai no ie was created by William Wimberly and Tony Pallitta from 8/30 to 9/3 during time off for Hurricane Dorian.
